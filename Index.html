The symbol, in general, is streamlined in dimensions which reflects the streamlined dimensions of the intellect. The pyramid shape and two lines on top symbolize the Babylonian design and Mesopotamian culture. The letter centering the gate shape refers to the first letter of Chaldean language ALAP (A) that descended from the Mesopotamian languages that first invented writing. Also, the letter ALAP (A) refers to the first letter of Arbil city name. The opened book shape in the middle of the pyramid shape dragging downward refers to the knowledge that emerged from the depth of civilization heading to the future.

                    <marquee direction="left">
                        The CUE was founded in December 2015 by His Grace Bishop Bashar Warda, bishop of the Chaldean
                        Catholic Diocese of Erbil in District 189, Ankawa, Erbil, Kurdistan Region-Iraq
                        Its foundation stone was laid on 20 October 2012. The campus of the university has an area of
                        30,000 square meters of land. The Italian Episcopal Conference offered 2.3 million euros for the
                        project. The Catholic University of the Holy Spirit in Lebanon was contacted for help and
                        guidance.
